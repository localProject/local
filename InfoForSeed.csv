I grew up in the restaurant business and it has always been my first love.  In early 2002, my mother-in-law, who lives with us, asked me to make a cheesecake. Well, I, being the good son-in-law (ha! ha!), made a recipe out of a book. All during the process, I had a taste in mind for the way this cake should turn out - I couldn’t wait to taste it. When I did, however, I was truly disappointed in both the taste and the texture. The challenge had begun. Over the next few months, all I could think about was the taste I had in mind. I changed this and changed that and baked and baked until I finally got the taste and texture I wanted. When we finally tasted the final recipe, we knew this was it! Good thing; I think my wife and mother-in-law were ready to run me out if I baked one more cheesecake for them to try! I then began to bake some for friends and family and I always received the same response. Soon, this obsession / hobby grew out of my kitchen and we set up shop. We now have twenty-two flavors of cheesecake and many other bakery items. I love to see the reaction of people trying these cakes for the first time; it really brings me a lot of joy. So, take my advice. Try one. Try several! These are some of the best cheesecakes you'll ever taste."

Thus, Cerminaro Vineyard was born. Each fall, Joe and Deborah Cerminaro, with the aid of friends and family, harvest several tons of grapes.
