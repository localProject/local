        local. has been designed to bring the goods and services of North Carolina to the global consumer.  
        We offer a convenient 'local market' for our customers that allows them to easily buy items from multiple vendors from one 'store'.  
        
        This also serves the local farmers and artisans by providing an outlet to sell their goods in one convenient location.  
        They can showcase their items without having individual websites so they can focus on what they love instead of just getting their product to 'market' 
        This is our attempt at making the world a little smaller and a little more friendly by bringing people together locally.
