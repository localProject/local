          local. has been designed to bring the goods and services of North Carolina to the global consumer. <br />
          We offer a convenient 'local market' for our customers that allows them to easily buy items from multiple vendors from one 'store'.
          <br />
          This also serves the local farmers and artisans by providing an outlet to sell their goods in one convenient location. <br />
          They can showcase their items without having individual websites so they can focus on what they love instead of just getting their product to 'market'. <br />
          This is our attempt at making the world a little smaller and a little more friendly by bringing people together. <br /><br />
          <h3>In a global community, are you ready to be a local.?</h3>
